# Git uncommit allows you to remove changes from your previous commit,
# without loosing any unstaged changes you may have.
#
# When called with no arguments, removes the entire commit (git reset HEAD^)
# When called with <filename>, removes changes to that file from the commit.
# Also useful is  git uncommit -p, which allows you to select which chunks to uncommit.
#
# see-also: git-amend
#
